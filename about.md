Hello, my name is Alexander Schneider. I am currently in my twenties and am finishing my masters in computer science at the Heinrich Heine University DÃ¼sseldorf.

My field of research are electronic and network voting systems, which could use a lot of love from the research community.
In my free time I love to engage in competitive computer games, since I have a lot of fun min-maxing said games.

This blog has the purpose to train my english writing skills while sharing things I deem interesting or cool.

If you want to contact me you can write an e-mail to alex@just-wegi.de
