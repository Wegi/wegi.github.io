# Introduction

Recently I read the bock "The Lean Startup" by Eric Reis. This post is a personal digest of the contents.
I read the book mainly, because I am on and off thinking about trying some of my side projects as a legitimate business.
Although I do not like the american startup culture of starting a company to sell it for as much money as possible and cashing out,
I thought this book could teach me some lessons, and it did as expected. 
If you haven't read the book yet and look for a reason to buy it or not, follow me along on my loose thoughts about
this book, where I generally liked most of the thoughts - that maybe should have been expressed more succinct.

# MVP

The core lesson I learned from the book is to speed up a certain cycle which consists of three steps.
Build, Measure, Learn. The faster one can cycle through this loop, the earlier one recognizes the need
to change course in the development of the project. I explicitly wrote project and not startup, since this methodology
is the dimple scientific mindset which can be applied to almost anything, that can evolve. But to get back to the point:
How do I speed up as fast as possible through this loop? Erics answer: The minimum viable product. Concentrate on a product
which delivers the bare minimum, then start selling and measuring. Then enhance with the gained knowledge and start measuring
as fast as you can again. After several rounds, where you may or may not have changed the course you should start to gain
benefits from the approach. Eric also emphasizes that the bare minimum is not a mass market product, but only for those
early adopters, which you can use to grow your product.

# Innovation Accounting

If the MVP is the core lesson, innovation acocunting is the close second. Innovation accounting proposes, that we do not
use static, old and dusty methods to account for success, since we desire to learn fast and improve upon our lessons.
The proposal is to use well defined metric, which measure the amount of innovation introduced with every cycle.
One method is the so called cohort testing, where every, for example, day is one cohort and you measure the change between cohorts.
For Example. On period A one the cohort has a 20% signup rate for your app and a 10% subscription rate. After introducing a feature
your cohort at period B may have still 20% signup but now 15% subsctiption rate. This clearly shows, that the new feature helped with the signup rate.
This is by the way one more advantage of MVPs. You allway know which feature change what metrics, since you aim to introduce the smallest possible
changes. 

# Rating

Overall this was an interesting read for me, because I never heard of the Lean Startup movement before. The book is partly a little bit
slow-going, but thats okay for a non-novel book. I definitely reccomend it to aspiring entrepeneurs or anybody who wants to introduce
a scientific method into some kind of development natured project.
