title: Using jekyll
---

Hello there,

this is the first post I'm writing on my new [jekyll blog](http://jekyllrb.com/).
I set up the blog with github pages using this [excellent tutorial](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) by Joshua Lande. It is quite easy and jekyll can also be run on a normal server if you don't wish to host it on github.

Feel free to check the about section to learn more about me.
